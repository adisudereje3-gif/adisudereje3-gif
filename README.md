<h1>Python & SQL Development Portfolio</h1>

<h4>Welcome to my project repository! This repository contains a collection of Python applications and SQL database implementations designed to solve real-world problems through logic and automation.</h4>

<h2>🚀 Projects Overview</h2>

<h2> 1. ATM Simulation System (Python)</h2>
An interactive console-based application that mimics the functionality of a real-world Automated Teller Machine.
Authentication: Secure PIN-based login system.
Transactions: Supports balance inquiry, cash deposits, and withdrawals.
Logic: Implements robust error handling to prevent over-drawing and invalid inputs.

<h2>2. Student Grade Calculator (Python & SQL)</h2>
A comprehensive tool for academic performance tracking.
Automated Grading: Converts numerical scores into academic grades ( A+, A, A-, B, C, etc.) using precise logical scales.
Performance Analysis: Calculates GPA and categorizes student standing (Excellent, Good, Poor).
Dual Implementation: Features both a Python script for quick logic and a SQL Scalar Function for database integration.

<h2>3. Department Placement Database (SQL Server)</h2>
A relational database schema designed for university department placements.
Relational Mapping: Tables for Students, Departments, Companies, and Placements.
Business Logic: Includes Stored Procedures for adding students and Triggers to prevent duplicate placements or ineligible entries (based on CGPA).

---

<h2>🛠️ Technical Stack</h2>
Languages: Python 3.12.8, T-SQL (MS SQL Server)
Concepts: Procedural Programming, Relational Database Management (RDBMS), Data Validation, and Trigger-based Automation.

---

<h2> 💻 How to Run</h2>
1. For Python Scripts:
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Run the command: `python atm_machine.py` or `python grade_calc.py`.
2. For SQL Scripts:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Copy the provided `.sql` files and execute them to build the database and functions.

<h2>📌 Future Enhancements</h2>
- [ ] Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the ATM project using Tkinter.
- [ ] Connect the Python frontend to the SQL Server backend for persistent data storage.
- [ ] Implement a web-based dashboard for the Placement System.
